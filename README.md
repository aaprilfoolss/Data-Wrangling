# Data Wrangling with The Movies Database and Netflix Titles

This is a final project submission for Udacity's 'Advanced Data Wrangling' course.

In this project, I gathered related datasets from different sources using different methods of gathering. I then assessed the data based on quality and tidiness metrics, performed necessary cleaning, and used the resulting data to answer specific research questions.

I used two datasets from "The Movies Dataset" on Kaggle (by user Rounak Banik)-- movies_metadata and keywords, along with the netflix_titles dataset from "Netflix Movies and TV Shows" on Kaggle (by user Shivam Bansal). The questions identified for analysis are as follows: What are the top keywords associated with popular movies? How has this changed over time? What is the overall trend of movie budgets? How do the budgets of movies available on Netflix compare to those not on the platform?
